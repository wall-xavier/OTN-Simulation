# OTN Simulation
The purpose of this program is to show the flow of photonic signals as they traverse an OTN (Optical Transport Network)

This simulation will follow a photonic signal through all components of the OTN showing things like, diffraction angles, loss, beam steering, and much more.

This is a work in progress, I am working to bring in support for most main components of an OTN system, eventaully bringing it all together to create a fully functioning optical network.
